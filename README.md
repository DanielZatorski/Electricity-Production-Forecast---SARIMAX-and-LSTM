# Electricity Production Forecast - SARIMAX and LSTM

## Overview

This project aims to forecast electricity production using two different methods: SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. The project demonstrates how to apply these techniques to time series data to predict future electricity production.


## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is monthly electricity generation for a period of years 1985 - 2021 .

## Evaluation

The models are evaluated based on metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and visualization of forecast results.
